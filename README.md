# 🏆 Raptors Football League

A simple **football league table website** I made when me and my friends hosted  
a local football tournament in our city.

## 📖 About
- Displays clubs, matches played, wins, draws, losses, goals, and points.  
- Inspired by the kind of tables you see on **World Cup / league websites**.  
- Basic styling with HTML + CSS to keep it clean and readable.

## 💡 Reflections
It’s a small project, but it meant a lot at the time because it gave  
our **community football league** a more professional touch.
